# unity-pull-and-push-with-ik
Unity Pull and Push objects like jedi force with additional IK animation settings.  
# Features      
Fairly simple scripts to pull and push objects with "E" key in third person. The script finds the closest object to pull next to player and then player can push it with force to the direction that camera is facing. There are also idle and moving animations with additional IK settings to turn the head of the character to the direction that camera is facing and put the hand next to the object when the objects is pulled.
