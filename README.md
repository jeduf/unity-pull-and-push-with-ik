# unity-pull-and-push-with-ik
Unity Pull and Push objects like jedi force with additional IK animation settings.  
# Features      
Fairly simple scripts to pull and push objects in third person. There are also idle and moving animations with additional IK settings to turn the head of the character to the direction that camera is facing and put the hand next to the object when the objects is pulled.
